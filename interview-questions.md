## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

- React lifecycle methods
  A: Each component in React has a lifecycle which you can monitor and manipulate during its three main phases.
  The three phases are: Mounting, Updating, and Unmounting.

- API
  A: Application Programming Interface. It is a set of routines, protocols, and tools for building software applications.

- event.preventDefault()
  A: a method tells the user agent that if the event does not get explicitly handled, its default action should not be taken as it normally would be.

- DOM events
  
  A: DOM Events are sent to notify code of interesting things that have taken place. Each event is represented by an object which is based on the Event interface, and may have additional custom fields and/or functions used to get additional information about what happened. Events can represent everything from basic user interactions to automated notifications of things happening in the rendering model.

- http verbs
  A: The primary or most-commonly-used HTTP verbs (or methods, as they are properly called) are POST, GET, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE. These correspond to create, read, update, and delete (or CRUD) operations, respectively. There are a number of other verbs, too, but are utilized less frequently.


- MVC
  A: MVC is an application design model comprised of three interconnected parts. They include the model (data), the view (user interface), and the controller (processes that handle input).
